#### Issues ####

In some distributions are issues with the fonts we recommend you to use python directly in those cases.

## Development ##

In order to enhance programmer productivity without the license limitations of some other platform and
generate with (almost) no pain a multi-platform GUI tool we use [Python](https://www.python.org/) and
[wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/) for the development of ChowChow.

Also [wxFormBuilder](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/) it's used for the generation and edition of some
of the GUI components.

[PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) it's used to construct the binary executables.

### Requeriments ###
